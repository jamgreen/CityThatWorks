This [chapter](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-439-revitalizing-urban-main-streets-mission-hill-egleston-square-boston-spring-2003/lecture-notes/busin_retention.pdf) focuses on existing opportunities to support such small businesses, in particular, immigrant-owned businesses serving primarily immigrant populations. These markets, of course, offer their own business challenges, including but not limited to, businesses that relatively little value add/profit potential, businesses that require a lot of self-exploitation (degraded work businesses), and already-neglected markets. To answer these myriad challenges PolicyLink offers two sets of policy recommendations for small business development and business retention:

1.  Small Business Development
    A.  Entrepreneurial development corporations
    B.  Financing programs
    C.  Micro-enterprise development and self-employment
    D.  Technical Assistance
    E.  Ombudsman offices- city offices designed to help businesses navigate city rules and regulations
    F.  Small business incubators
    G.  Business Networks and Associations
    H. Direct business ownership by a community group
    I.  Set-asides for minority-owned businesses
2.  Business Retention Tools
    A.  Business consulting- meet with individual firms and help them grow
    B.  Business Communications- maintain communications with small business and small business associations to stay abreast of issues
    C.  Planned Manufacturing Districts
    D.  Industrial Park development
    E.  Redevelop vacant spaces for existing businesses
    F.  Brownfield Redevelopment
    G.  "Early Warning Systems"- alerting communities and businesses to economic catastrophes like planned plant closures
    H.  Work out ownership issues- small businesses with aging owners need succession plans and not simply close
    I.  Manage Utility Costs
    J.  Manufacturing targeted financing programs
    K.  Industrial Service Offices- one sotp permitting and business support services
    L.  Job Trainings
